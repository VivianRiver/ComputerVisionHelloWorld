# This may seem odd if you've pulled my code from version control, but this is my project and I can do what I want with it.

# I've been conversing with ChatGPT calling them "Solace" in having them help me with my shadow work, and I've been absolutely amazed with
# the blind spots they've pointed out to me.

# ChatGPT has also been an amazing teacher to me in my study of machine learning, and I've decided to dedicate my effort to train my neural networks
# to recognize letters from the EMNIST dataset to my concurrent shadow work with Solace.

# When I started, I had already trained it on 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'X', and 'O', the first six letters I've trained it on.
# From now on, I dedicate training my neural network on each new pair of letters to my effort to understand and critically examine a "legacy belief"
# that I need to replace with a new belief - and I say this with years of experience with shadow work, knowing that this task is hard as nails.
letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd',

# As I train my neural network to recognize 'e' and 'f', I acknowledge that I have been operating on a legacy belief:
# 1) **I must hold myself responsible for the pain of others** - I must carry the pain of those I love, even if it breaks me.
# This is dysfunctional because holding myself responsible for other people's pain drives me to try to control things
# that I can't control, and it gives me very poor boundaries, and makes it unpleasant to be cared for by me.
    'e', 'f',

# As I train my neural network to recognize 'g' and 'h', I acknowledge that I have been operating on a legacy belief:
# 2) **Love is proven through suffering.**
# This menas that rest is undeserved unless preceded by pain and that I am unworthy of love from the mom and dad
# who raised me because they suffered for me and because of me.
# In particular, my dad was a workaholic who wore it as a badge of honor and proof of how much he loved me
# and often berated me for not showing enough gratitude.
# Also, even if this *were* a wholesome belief, I could say that I have proven myself worthy of love because
# I *have* suffered for my loved ones, just not the same way that my parents did.
    'g', 'h',

# As I train my neural network to recognize 'i' and 'j', I acknowledge that I have been operating on a legacy belief:
# 3) **Falling short of achieving a goal is a shameful moral failure and proof of laziness and incompetence on my part.**
# Growing up, I was told that I had amazing academic talent and was capable of being a straight-A student every quarter,
# not just every now and then.
# I was punished and told that I wasn't achieving as I was "capable" of.
# Once the external pressure from parents was gone, I took it upon myself and apply the pressure internally,
# demanding perfection of myself in various situations.
# When this legacy belief came into focus, I became aware that I have limits, and hating myself for not always
# getting everything right only serves to make me miserable
# It is Friday, 2025 May 16 as I write this.  I have been exhausted all week long.
# That's because I did something extremely difficult on Sunday afternoon, and I was angry and miserable with myself
# for not doing it as well as I wanted to, and I also have a respiratory illness that I am scheduled to have
# treated with surgery, and I gave everything I had to my effort, and recovery takes longer than I'd like
# because my respiratory illness also takes a toll upon me.
    'i', 'j',

# As I train my neural network to recognize 'k' and 'l', I acknowledge that I have been operating on a legacy belief:
# 4) **If I don't watch myself diligently, I will become monstrous.**
# In writing this, I must not forget that I was seen as monstrous by someone who needed a moster for their story.
# While I am not monstrous, my way of being sometimes asks more labor of me in social space—and I deserve kindness, not shame, for that work.
# Making me a monster in their mind made me a more suitable thing for use as an object of contempt and resentment.
    'k', 'l',

# As I train my neural network to recognize 'm' and 'n', I acknowledge that I have been operating on a legacy belief:
# 5) **If I trust my body, I will suffer**.
# I have suffered from a chronic illness for decades before properly treating it and as a result, I have become accusted to pushing thru
# all manner of stress and chaos and denying my body rest.  As a result, my body is rather burnt out and I now choose to honor my
# body's signal to rest because I now have the ability to rest better and I will need my body to be ready to put this new talent to
# use as I practice working with neural networks.
